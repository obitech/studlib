# studlib.c -- A small C library

This is a small a library with common functions I keep using in my Masters program. I've mostly written it for myself but feel free to use, fork, change it anytime! If you spot any mistakes or bad practices (which I'm sure there are plenty) please don't hesitate to submit and issue or pull request.
